## That's It!

After redeployment (1-2 minutes), open your Telegram app and try again. It will work! ‚úÖ

## Why This Fixes It

Your Vercel deployment needs the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` to verify that requests are really coming from Telegram. Without it, it rejects all requests with "Invalid Telegram data".

You already have this token in your local `.env.local` file, but Vercel doesn't know about it. You need to add it manually to Vercel's environment variables (just like you did with `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
